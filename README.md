# Geodesics

## Goal

The aim of this group project was to develop a short Python code to find the shortest path between two points on an implictly defined surface.
Instead of using Dijkstra's algorithm, the original idea of the algorithm is to use differential calculus in order to solve second order differential equations defined thanks to implictly defined surfaces. More insights on the equations and solving method can be found in the report (in French).

## Results

You can find various results on this repository for multiple surfaces.
